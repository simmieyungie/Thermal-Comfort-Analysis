# Thermal-Comfort-Analysis

```
A Climatological assessment of Thermal comfort over Lagos, Nigeria. 

```

**What is thermal comfort?** 
  It is regarded as a condition of the mind in which satisfaction is expressed with the Thermal environment. 
  There are many indices that have been proposed for evaluating thermal comfort, for this study I used the Thoms Discomfort Index otherwise known as Temperature Humidity Index (THI). 
  
  
  ### **Aims** 
The aim of the study is to evaluate/examine the variation of Bioclimatic conditions over Lagos-Nigeria using the Thermal comfort index as well as making comparisons between thermal comfort onsets, decline and trends utilizing Ikorodu, Ikeja and Lagos Island as the case study. 

### **Objectives**
- Examine Extreme Temperature and Relative Humidity Events
-	Examine the thermal comfort conditions over these areas using the algorithm 
- Capture the number of heating days (strong heat events) yearly and monthly and as well test for significance. i.e THI >= 27â„ƒ
